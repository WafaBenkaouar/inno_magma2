This is a clone of the Milton Bradley children's game of 1978: Simon.

I wrote it as a learning exercise because it offered many challenges:
    Complex user interface involving sound synchronized with display and user action.
    Attention to the passage of time for a correct rendition of the user experience.
    Complex game action.
    Underlying simple game concept easily appreciated by a user.
    
I was able to build on some extremely good work by others:

The ButtonGridView that gives the interface its four color buttons for the game
comes from a Tutorial by Ivan Memruk appearing on his blog, "Mind the Robot."
See: "Android BeatzL: Making a Drum Machine App"
at: http://mindtherobot.com/blog/420/android-beatz-making-a-drum-machine-app/

Although I initially wrote a RelativeLayout grid of buttons, I wasn't getting the behavior
I wanted.  Ivan points out that one view behaving as a grid of buttons works a lot better
for things like musical instruments because the events land where you want them, not in
the wrong button (fixed in Froyo but...).

The beautiful button bitmaps are derived from the graphics Rich Dellinger did in photoshop for the
Simon Extreme program for the Mac.  (I cut apart the .psd image file he gave as an example.)

I was able to achieve the extremely accurate mimic of the Simon game behavior because of the
meticulously detailed reverse engineering done by Simon Inns documented on his website at:

The game itself, its design, layout, action and name are properly credited to
Milton Bradley / Hasbro which owns the game, and to the genius of Ralph Baer who conceived of
and implemented the game.  See: http://www.dieterkoenig.at/ccc/english/se_story_simon.htm

The Simon name is a registered trademark of the Milton Bradley Hasbro Corporation.

The game is covered by US Patent 4207087, issued 10 June 1980.
